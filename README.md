# flutter-movie-app
This is an updated implementation of a previous movie app created in Android Studio for an end-of-semester project. In this updated version, the application is cross-platform and allows for user device versatility. The application displays several films as poster images. Upon clicking one of these images, you will be navigated to a details page showing additional information on the selected film (director, a synopsis, and the ability to view a trailer if available).
To run this application, clone the repository, then run the **flutter run** command.
